                <p>Climate Smart Food is a digital summit hosted by FoodNavigator and AgTechNavigator. It brings together leaders in sustainable food, tech innovation, and agri-business. The event had strong content and speakers but lacked a cohesive digital identity that matched its ambition. I was brought in to lead a full rebrand and digital redesign</p>

                <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p>The existing branding looked unrefined and inconsistent. The logo lacked structure, didn’t scale across touchpoints, and didn’t reflect the themes of climate, growth, or innovation. On the digital side, the website was copy-heavy, outdated, and difficult to navigate. It failed to convey the calibre of the event or drive meaningful engagement.</p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-old-logo.jpg" alt="The old Climate Smart Food logo" height="780" width="1053">
                
                <h3>Logo ideation</h3>
                <p>The event team asked for a new visual direction that would reflect the event’s key themes: climate, food, growth, and innovation. I began exploring concepts that would bring these elements together in a simple, scalable icon. Early sketches focused on cyclical forms, food system references, and upward motion to represent both sustainability and progress.</p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/climate-smart-food-logo-sketches.jpg" alt="Paper sketches of logo ideas" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/climate-smart-food-logo-ideas.jpg" alt="A large grid of logo iconography ideas" height="780" width="1053">
                <p>These ideas evolved into three refined logo concepts, each meeting the team’s criteria and offering flexibility across formats.</p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-logo-concept-1.jpg" alt="Climate Smart Food Broadcast Series logo idea one" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-logo-concept-2.jpg" alt="Climate Smart Food Broadcast Series logo idea two" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-logo-concept-3.jpg" alt="Climate Smart Food Broadcast Series logo idea three" height="780" width="1053">
                
                <h3>Brand finalisation</h3>
                <p>The team selected a concept built around a circular symbol that subtly forms a "C" in the negative space. At the centre of the mark is a stylised plant, designed with upward-pointing arrows to represent growth, tech, and future-focused thinking. The final logo balanced meaning with simplicity and served as the foundation for a broader visual identity system.</p>

                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mobile-mockup.jpg" alt="A mobile laid on top of a rock featuring the hero section of the website homepage" height="780" width="1053">

                <h3>Website design and development</h3>
                <p>Once the branding was approved, I redesigned the event website to bring the new identity to life. The previous site lacked hierarchy, clarity, and visual engagement. Users were overwhelmed by long sections of text and struggled to find relevant information. </p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-old-website.jpg" alt="Screengrabs of the old website" height="780" width="1053">
                <p>I introduced a more modern layout that prioritised structure and simplicity, with clear content sections, refined copy, and high-contrast calls to action that encouraged conversions.</p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-up-1.jpg" alt="A laptop open on a sofa arm showing the homepage hero of the Climate Smart Food website" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-screen2.jpg" alt="A laptop screen of the website homepage introduction section" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-screen3.jpg" alt="A laptop screen of the website homepage programme section" height="780" width="1053">
                <p>Design decisions were also shaped by the event’s sustainability goals. Images were optimised to reduce page weight and improve performance. Speaker profiles were displayed in greyscale to maintain visual consistency and reduce unnecessary visual noise. Pop-up modals were used to streamline navigation and limit the number of individual pages.</p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-screen4.jpg" alt="A laptop screen of the website homepage speakers section" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-screen5.jpg" alt="Three mobile phone screens of each section of the website homepage" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-screen6.jpg" alt="A laptop screen of the website agenda page" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-mock-screen7.jpg" alt="Three mobile phone screens of the speakers page, agenda page and the pop-up speaker modal" height="780" width="1053">
                <p>The dark green and off-white palette was selected to align with the event’s climate-conscious message while offering a calm, legible visual experience. While these colours don’t directly reduce emissions on most displays, the design reflects a thoughtful, values-driven approach that reinforces sustainability through tone, clarity, and restraint.</p>

                <h3>Asset creation</h3>
                <p>I created a series of digital banners and promotional assets for use across FoodNavigator and AgTechNavigator channels. These were designed for flexibility, clarity, and visual consistency with the new brand.</p>
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-old-banners.jpg" alt="A grid of the old banner adverts" height="780" width="1053">
                <img class="modal-target" src="./assets/jpg/csf-banners.jpg" alt="A grid of the new banner adverts" height="780" width="1053">
                <p>I also redesigned the email templates to feel cleaner, more engaging, and better aligned with the overall identity, helping to increase open and click-through rates.</p>
